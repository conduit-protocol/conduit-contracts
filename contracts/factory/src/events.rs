/// The factory's `pause`/`unpause` are already idempotent — a redundant call
/// reverts with `AlreadyPaused`/`NotPaused` rather than silently no-op'ing.
/// These events close the remaining gap: they let off-chain infrastructure
/// (indexers, relayers) positively confirm that a state transition committed,
/// rather than having to infer it from a bare "ok" that an ambiguous or
/// rate-limited RPC response may have dropped or duplicated. A relayer that
/// retried after a lost response can reconcile against the emitted event
/// instead of re-issuing a call it can no longer distinguish as a no-op.
///
/// Publication and the `set_paused` storage write are part of the same Soroban
/// transaction, so either both commit or both roll back — an event is never
/// emitted for a transition that did not actually persist.
